# Closest Pair of Points Problem

This repository contains an implementation of the foundational algorithm described in the paper “On the Closest Pair of Points Problem” (Hitz & Hitz, 2026), which addresses the classical geometric problem of finding the two closest points in a set. The focus of this project is on replicating the baseline brute-force algorithm (cppAP) as described in the paper.
